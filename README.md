# mace
 
MaceEngine is my personal game engine that I develop in my free time. It is not designed to be general purpose, but instead fills my own personal needs. It is being developed using C++17, EnTT, sol3, and SFML.

## features
- Entity component system
- Lua scripting
- Infinite tilemap system
- Camera management (scrolling)
